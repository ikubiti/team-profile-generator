## Description

This application is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. The application enables the manager of the team to conveniently send emails to any member of team from the generated webpage. It also allows the manager to access the GitHub pages of engineers in the team.

My objectives for this application is based on the following user story and acceptance criteria;

### User Story

```

I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

```

WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application

## Features

In addition to fulfilling the above requirements, the application also has the following features:

1.  The application prevents the user from adding members with the same employee id.
2.  The application allows the user to edit the details of team members except the manager.
3.  It will accept the addition of team members in any order but will always display Engineers before Interns irrespective of the order of entry.
4.  There's no limit to the size of the team.

- npm test

The demonstration video link found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fXBfH-75GW0r7_bJPNF_Pr3EMf7piItB/view?usp=sharing) provides an example of its usage.
